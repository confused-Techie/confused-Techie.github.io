# About Me

I'm a developer dedicated to Open Source, with a passion for the Self Hosted Software community, who would prefer to patch CVE's rather than work with CSS.

As primarily a `JavaScript` developer I've become familiar with `TypeScript` and `CoffeeScript` by association, as well as being extremely comfortable working within a `NodeJS` environment,
or being happy to optimize a website for Google's Lighthouse Scores on the web.

As I'll detail below, I'm actively involved in a large community project, serving as a Core Developer, as well as Community Manager, I have experience explaining and detailing issues to teams, or individuals.
Where in the `Pulsar` Organization we work together, and as a team, always.

I actively manage and host several websites all within Google Cloud. Being familiar with Google's offerings of Google's App Engine, Secret Manager, Cloud Scheduler, Artifact Registry, Cloud Storage, and Cloud Run.

Experienced with architecting either a single monolithic application, or several microservices to accomplish goals as needed.

Familiar with all manner of tools or services or libraries, such as `Docker`, `JSDoc`, `ExpressJS`, `CirrusCI`, or many automated code review, code building, or testing tools.

As the current Database Admin for the `Pulsar` organization I've been managing and architecting our PostgreSQL Database since it's creation.
Additionally, being the DNS admin for `Pulsar` managing all DNS changes for our many services.

Otherwise familiar with languages such as `JavaScript`, `Golang`, `CoffeeScript`, `HTML`, `CSS`, and `C#`.
