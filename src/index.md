## My Perfect Tech Stack

When I'm the master of my own domain, and able to make all choices for a tech stack, ideally below is what I'd be using.
Of course function comes before familiarity and I'd ensure no other tools are better suited for the job.

But in a perfect world:

* `NodeJS` would be the execution environment.
* `JavaScript` would be the language of choice.
* `Google Cloud` would be used to host any services needed.
* `EJS` would serve as the HTML templating language.
* `Jest` would be the test runner suite.
* `ExpressJS` would be the HTTP handler.
* `PostgreSQL` would be the Database.
* `JSDoc` would be the documentation builder.
* `Tailwind` would be the CSS Framework.
* `Docker` would be the manager of any microservices.
